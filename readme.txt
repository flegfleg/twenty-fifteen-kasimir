== Notes ==

= Customization =

You can customize the colors of page, sidebar, sidebar text & headlines (headlines also color the buttons placed by the plugins mentioned above). Just click "Customizer->Colors".

Please note that some of the color changes are only applied after clicking "Publish".

= Why a child theme instead of another standalone theme? =

The parent theme gets auto-updates for security and new Wordpress-features.
